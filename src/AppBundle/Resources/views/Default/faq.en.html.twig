<h1 id="faq">FAQ</h1>

<p>Here are a few common questions that a player might have
while playing.</p>

<p><em>Can I play with my friend if we are both using villain (or hero)
decks?</em></p>

<ul>
<li>Yes. You can play against anyone, regardless of what
affiliation their deck is. You could even use the same
characters they are using!</li>
</ul>

<p><em>When one of my characters is about to take damage, do I
have to use their shields?</em></p>

<ul>
<li>Yes, if able.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>If I play an upgrade on an exhausted character, can I
immediately roll its die into my pool?</em></p>

<ul>
<li>No. You must wait until the character readies again to
roll the new die into your pool, along with the rest of the
character’s dice.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Can I redeploy an upgrade to a character who already has
the maximum number of upgrades?</em></p>

<ul>
<li>Yes, but you would have to discard one of the character’s
upgrades to make room.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>What is the difference between ranged and melee damage?</em></p>

<ul>
<li>There is no functional difference. The only difference
between the two is the cards that interact with them and
that you cannot resolve them as part of the same action.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Can I use the special ability on an exhausted card?</em></p>

<ul>
<li>You can use the special ability on an exhausted card,
provided the ability does not require you to exhaust the
card in order to use it.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Can I have more than five cards in my hand?</em></p>

<ul>
<li>Yes. You can have more cards in your hand than your hand
size. You would not draw more cards during the upkeep
phase, though, if you have more cards in hand than your
hand size after discarding.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Can I discard a Gray upgrade to reduce the cost of a non-
Gray upgrade, and vice versa?</em></p>

<ul>
<li>Yes. You can discard an upgrade of any color to reduce the
cost of another upgrade, regardless of its color.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Do I have to resolve all of my dice of the same symbol
at once?</em></p>

<ul>
<li>No. You resolve only as many dice of one symbol as you
wish while taking the Resolve Dice action.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>What happens if I play a support card that has “Action” listed
on it?</em></p>

<ul>
<li>You now have a new action that you can take. You do not
resolve the action when you play the card.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>What happens if I want to play a copy of a unique card but
my opponent has one in play?</em></p>

<ul>
<li>Each player can have one copy of a unique card in play
(though you can still have two in your deck). So you can
play your copy, but once you have a copy of it in play, you
cannot play another one.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>If I am using multiples of the same character, do I have to
remember which dice came from which character?</em></p>

<ul>
<li>Yes. Make sure that each character’s dice are positioned
in such a way that it is obvious which character they came
from. If a character is defeated, its specific dice must be
removed from the pool, if they are there.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>What happens if I replace an upgrade with another upgrade
that costs fewer resources?</em></p>

<ul>
<li>You play the new upgrade for free.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Is a character die any die that the character has?</em></p>

<ul>
<li>No. A character die is a die that corresponds to the
character card. An upgrade is never a character die and is
always called out by card text as an upgrade die.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>What is the difference between a turn and a round?</em></p>

<ul>
<li>A turn is one player’s action. A round consists of an action
phase and an upkeep phase.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Can Rey (<span class="icon-set-AW"></span>38) take an additional action if I claim the
Imperial Armory (<span class="icon-set-AW"></span>169) with her?</em></p>

<ul>
<li>No. You must pass all future actions once you claim
the battlefield, including the additional action that Rey
gives you.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>If I resolve Poe Dameron’s (<span class="icon-set-AW"></span>29) special to use the special on
Black One (<span class="icon-set-AW"></span>32), can I roll Black One’s die into the pool even
though it says “reroll”?</em></p>

<ul>
<li>No. The Black One die is not actually in your pool, so you
cannot reroll it.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>What happens when an after ability triggers off of a before
ability, and there is another after ability in the queue?</em></p>

<ul>
<li>After abilities enter a queue and wait their turn to resolve.
If an after ability triggers during the resolution of any other
ability, it will resolve after that ability and any other after
ability already in the queue.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Can I use Cunning (<span class="icon-set-AW"></span>65) to trigger discard an opponent’s
Thermal Detonator (<span class="icon-set-AW"></span>67) or Infantry Grenades (<span class="icon-set-AW"></span>17)?</em></p>

<ul>
<li>Yes. You will deal the damage to an opponent’s
characters and then discard the Thermal Detonator or
Infantry Grenades.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Can I use Cunning (<span class="icon-set-AW"></span>65) to switch an opponent’s Sith
Holocron (<span class="icon-set-AW"></span>16) with a card in my hand?</em></p>

<ul>
<li>No. You cannot have an opponent’s card in your hand or
deck. The end result is that the Sith Holocron has no effect.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Can I ignore spending 5 resources to trigger the special
ability on Crime Lord (<span class="icon-set-AW"></span>23) when I claim Rebel War Room
(<span class="icon-set-AW"></span>171)?</em></p>

<ul>
<li>No. The Rebel War Room only ignores the resource cost
printed on a die.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Can I exhaust a card that has an action that I cannot fully
resolve in order to stall the round? Like a Backup Muscle
(<span class="icon-set-AW"></span>99) with no damage on it or playing Noble Sacrifice (<span class="icon-set-AW"></span>118)
when I have no Blue characters.</em></p>

<ul>
<li>You can use the action/play the card but it does not stall
the round. Because the only effect when you used Backup
Muscle or Noble Sacrifice was the card being exhausted or
played, you are considered to have passed your turn.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>How does Cunning (<span class="icon-set-AW"></span>65) interact with an opponent’s Black
One (<span class="icon-set-AW"></span>32)?</em></p>

<ul>
<li>When you use the special ability on Cunning, you resolve
it as if the card with the special ability you are using is
your own. However, you do not ever remove the Black One
die from your pool so you cannot resolve the replacement
effect to reroll it.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>I have a Count Dooku (<span class="icon-set-AW"></span>9) with 1 remaining health, and my
opponent resolves a die showing 2 ranged damage against it.
However, they also have an Admiral Ackbar (<span class="icon-set-AW"></span>27) in play and
before I take the damage I discard the last card in my hand
to block one of the incoming damage. Can I then assign the
2 damage from Ackbar’s ability before the 2 ranged damage
resolves, killing Dooku and dodging the 2 damage from
the die?</em></p>

<ul>
<li>When you resolve Count Dooku’s “Before” ability and
discard the last card in your hand, Admiral Ackbar’s “After”
ability is added to the queue. However, the 2 ranged
damage die has already been added to the queue, and was
just interrupted by the “Before” ability. Therefore, Ackbar’s
ability enters the queue behind the 2 ranged damage. So
the die will resolve, killing Dooku, and then you will have to
take 2 damage on one of your other characters.</li>
</ul>

</ul>

<h4 id="faq-aw-9">Count Dooku (<span class="icon-set-AW"></span>9)</h4>

damage and Count Dooku can only gain 1 shield.</p></li>

action, Dooku could gain a shield for each one, because
each die is resolved separately.</p></li>
</ul>

<h4 id="faq-aw-126">Daring Escape (<span class="icon-set-AW"></span>126)</h4>

<ul>
<li>After rerolling the dice, you remove all of your opponent’s
