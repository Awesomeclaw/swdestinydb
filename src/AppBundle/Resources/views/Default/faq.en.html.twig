<h1 id="faq">FAQ</h1>

<p>Here are a few common questions that a player might have
while playing.</p>

<p><em>Can I play with my friend if we are both using villain (or hero)
decks?</em></p>

<ul>
<li>Yes. You can play against anyone, regardless of what
affiliation their deck is. You could even use the same
characters they are using!</li>
</ul>

<p><em>When one of my characters is about to take damage, do I
have to use their shields?</em></p>

<ul>
<li>Yes, if able.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Can I redeploy an upgrade to a character who already has
the maximum number of upgrades?</em></p>

<ul>
<li>Yes, but you would have to discard one of the character’s
upgrades to make room.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>What is the difference between ranged and melee damage?</em></p>

<ul>
<li>There is no functional difference. The only difference
between the two is the cards that interact with them and
that you cannot resolve them as part of the same action.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Can I use the special ability on an exhausted card?</em></p>

<ul>
<li>You can use the special ability on an exhausted card,
provided the ability does not require you to exhaust the
card in order to use it.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Can I have more than five cards in my hand?</em></p>

<ul>
<li>Yes. You can have more cards in your hand than your hand
size. You would not draw more cards during the upkeep
phase, though, if you have more cards in hand than your
hand size after discarding.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Can I discard a Gray upgrade to reduce the cost of a non-
Gray upgrade, and vice versa?</em></p>

<ul>
<li>Yes. You can discard an upgrade of any color to reduce the
cost of another upgrade, regardless of its color.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Do I have to resolve all of my dice of the same symbol
at once?</em></p>

<ul>
<li>No. You resolve only as many dice of one symbol as you
wish while taking the Resolve Dice action.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>What happens if I play a support card that has “Action” listed
on it?</em></p>

<ul>
<li>You now have a new action that you can take. You do not
resolve the action when you play the card.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>What happens if I want to play a copy of a unique card but
my opponent has one in play?</em></p>

<ul>
<li>Each player can have one copy of a unique card in play
(though you can still have two in your deck). So you can
play your copy, but once you have a copy of it in play, you
cannot play another one.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>If I am using multiples of the same character, do I have to
remember which dice came from which character?</em></p>

<ul>
<li>Yes. Make sure that each character’s dice are positioned
in such a way that it is obvious which character they came
from. If a character is defeated, its specific dice must be
removed from the pool, if they are there.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>What happens if I replace an upgrade with another upgrade
that costs fewer resources?</em></p>

<ul>
<li>You play the new upgrade for free.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Is a character die any die that the character has?</em></p>

<ul>
<li>No. A character die is a die that corresponds to the
character card. An upgrade is never a character die and is
always called out by card text as an upgrade die.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>What is the difference between a turn and a round?</em></p>

<ul>
<li>A turn is one player’s action. A round consists of an action
phase and an upkeep phase.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Can Rey (@@38) take an additional action if I claim the
Imperial Armory (@@169) with her?</em></p>

<ul>
<li>No. You must pass all future actions once you claim
the battlefield, including the additional action that Rey
gives you.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>If I resolve Poe Dameron’s (@@29) special to use the special on
Black One (@@32), can I roll Black One’s die into the pool even
though it says “reroll”?</em></p>

<ul>
<li>No. The Black One die is not actually in your pool, so you
cannot reroll it.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>What happens when an after ability triggers off of a before
ability, and there is another after ability in the queue?</em></p>

<ul>
<li>After abilities enter a queue and wait their turn to resolve.
If an after ability triggers during the resolution of any other
ability, it will resolve after that ability and any other after
ability already in the queue.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Can I use Cunning (@@65) to trigger discard an opponent’s
Thermal Detonator (@@67) or Infantry Grenades (@@17)?</em></p>

<ul>
<li>Yes. You will deal the damage to an opponent’s
characters and then discard the Thermal Detonator or
Infantry Grenades.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Can I use Cunning (@@65) to switch an opponent’s Sith
Holocron (@@16) with a card in my hand?</em></p>

<ul>
<li>No. You cannot have an opponent’s card in your hand or
deck. The end result is that the Sith Holocron has no effect.</li>
</ul>
